# Sweat Rewards

A web application where the user can see if they have won any of the prize draws they have entered.

Currently users are able to see if they have won on Sweat Notion or in the Sweat Wallet app but it is not the best experience. For the mobile app you have to manually check each reward if you have won. For Sweat Notion, some users struggle with finding the search bar. The search time is also slow and sometimes does not work.

This web application was created to provide users a better user experience. It also directs users on where to go if they have any issues and answers common questions.

- Node.js and Express.js to create an API for the database
